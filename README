NAME
    Class::Method::ModifiersX::Override - adds "override method => sub
    {...}" support to Class::Method::Modifiers

SYNOPSIS
       use v5.14;
       use strict;
       use Test::More;
   
       package Foo {
          sub new { bless []=> shift }
          sub foo { return "foo" }
       }
   
       package Foo::Bar {
          BEGIN { our @ISA = 'Foo' }
          use Class::Method::ModifiersX::Override;
          override foo => sub {
             return uc super;
          };
       }
   
       is( Foo::Bar->new->foo, "FOO" );
       done_testing();

    (Note that the synopsis shows Perl v5.14+ syntax for package
    declaration, but this module and its accompanying Moo and Role::Tiny
    wrappers support Perl v5.8 and above.)

DESCRIPTION
    Class::Method::ModifiersX::Override extends Class::Method::Modifiers
    with the "override" method modifier, allowing you to use this Moose
    syntactic sugar for overriding superclass methods in non-Moose classes.

    See Moose::Manual::MethodModifiers for details of how "override" and its
    companion function "super" work.

    This module exports two functions:

    "override NAME, CODE"
    "super"

    If you want to use these with Moo classes or role, or with Role::Tiny
    roles, please look at MooX::Override or Role::TinyX::Override instead.

CAVEATS
    This implementation of "override" piggybacks onto
    Class::Method::Modifiers' implementation of "around". As a result, when
    multiple method modifiers are applied to the same method, the order in
    which they are applied might not match Moose, where "override" modifiers
    are "innermost".

    Given that this implementation of "override" piggybacks onto "around",
    there's almost no reason to use it; you can just use "around" instead.
    This module mostly exists as an answer to people who complain that Moo
    doesn't support "override"/"super", but it may also be helpful porting
    Moose code to Moo.

DEPENDENCIES
    Class::Method::ModifiersX::Override requires Perl 5.008, and the
    Class::Method::Modifiers package (which is available from CPAN).

    The accompanying modules MooX::Override and Role::TinyX::Override
    require Moo and Role::Tiny respectively. However, the installation
    scripts for this distribution do not check that these are installed. If
    you use MooX::Override or Role::TinyX::Override, it is assumed that you
    have installed their dependencies separately.
